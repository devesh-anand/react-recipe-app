# React Recipe App

<a href="https://pvt-react-recipe-app.vercel.app/">Live Demo</a>

A simple react app to search recipes.
I used <a href="https://developer.edamam.com/edamam-recipe-api">Edamam Recipe Search API</a> to fetch search results of recipes.

To successfully run the app you'll need API ID and key.<br>
The link to the live app uses my personal keys that I haven't put in this public repo for obvious reasons.

It's free to sign up, and if you want to run the app, here are the steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Go to `src > App.js`.
3. Put your API ID and key in the variables `APP_ID` and `APP_KEY` respectively.
4. Save and run script `npm start`.
5. Search recipe of your choice and get your hands dirty in the kitchen.
